# Technology Used
> Developed in React.js, Node.js.
> Express
> Socket.IO
> The front-end is deployed using Netlify
> The server is deployed using Heroku
<hr>


# How It Works?
> Chateau has a room system where each room can hold can hold multiple people.  
> In the home screen you only have to put in a user name, and a room name.  You can create a room or enter an existing room.
> To use it with your friends simply write a room name and click "Join", and then give that name to your friends so they can join.
<hr>

# Ideas for a future build:
> Color Schemes to identify specific people when a room has more than 2 users.
> Allowing the room creator to set a password or lock the room.
> Allow the room creator to set a specific room capacity.
> Allow users to see the list of rooms that are not locked.
